SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

1. Intel processor capable of using SSSE3 instructions. 
   Please refer to
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSSE3 for a complete list.
   While AMD processors probably work, CasparCG Server has only been tested on
   Intel processors.

2. Windows 7 (64-bit) strongly recommended.
   CasparCG Server has also been used successfully on Windows 7 (32-bit) 
   and Windows XP SP2 (32-bit only.)
   NOT SUPPORTED: Windows 8, Windows 2003 Server and Windows Vista.

3. A graphics card (GPU) capable of OpenGL 3.0 is required.
   We strongly recommend that you use a separate graphics card, and avoid
   using the built-in GPU that exists in many CPUs, since your performance
   will suffer.

4. Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package must be installed.
   See link in the Installation section below.
   
5. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or later must be installed.
   See link in the Installation section below.
   
6. Windows' "Aero" theme and "ClearType" font smoothing must be disabled
   as they have been known to interfere with transparency in Flash templates,
   and can also cause problems with Vsync when outputting to computer screens.
